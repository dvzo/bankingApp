$ OBSTACLES

1) Trying to have multiple scanners. I tried having one scanner per method, but closing one would close System.in.
	So I had to reference one scanner
	
	SOLVED: driver will hold static scanner, as well as static lists
	
2) I wanted to append objects to the text file with serialization but appending objects gave some errors.
	To solve, I have to reference one list with all users
	
	SOLVED: I have to keep updating the list wherever an object is removed or added
	
** Using one scanner, lists, serial objects all in the driver and reference them in the classes
	- only closing streams when program exits
	- creating the text files here as well
	
3) IOException for reading objects with object input stream.
	It seems that there is no way for readObject to know how many bytes to read. Therefore, I had to catch the IOException to avoid
	reaching the EOF.
	- log this

4) customer>deposit
	- get index kept giving -1, so i had to create a loop to get the correct index of matching user
	
X) Customer>apply
	- For some reason, the customer won't keep track of its application status after the program closes
	- this can result in multiple applications from the same user after they exited the program
	- because of this, i implemented methods for employee to remove all pending applications under the same name
		if they are approved/denied.

5) Unable to implement Junit

$ TODO
2) Log
 - added one logging to serial classes; where eof is reached
3) Junit
	
DONT FORGET to delete data files for final submission
